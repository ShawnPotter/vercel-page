# Personal Vercel Page Repo

## Intentions

The intention for this repo is to follow along with a project on [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMx51wpd7g4&list=PLzEtLrsIuN1GT53K1U8c3XO5F7kffrhgo&index=6&t=1s), adapting and refining it for my own purposes. The project will initial start out with Next.js/React.js and Tailwind CSS.

Tailwind CSS seems to be in high demand so this is going to be my main practice project for putting learning into practice. I'll also be using this chance to develop further with TypeScript.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
